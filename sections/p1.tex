	It's monday morning. You're sitting in your mathematics lecture. The professor asks you to solve the following equation:
	
	\begin{center}
		$5 + 2 = ?$
	\end{center}
	
	Within a fraction of a second, you yell "It's seven!" and the professor lauds you. You lean back, thinking "Pfsh! That was easy."  We believe that you just undervalued one of the most incredible tools that you have been blessed with: the human visual system.
