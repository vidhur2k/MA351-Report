Perceptrons are a great tool for building logical functions that would be extremely difficult to explicitly express in standard logical statements. However, this is not where their true power lie. Perceptrons are very old technology and mathematics, but they are key in building the most powerful tools. Neural networks and machine learning algorithms utilize many of the concepts and theory that underlie perceptrons to build a much powerful system. These neural nets have already accomplished great feats such as beatings humans in chess and the Chinese game Go. These neural nets and machine learning algorithms are the key to unlock true artificial intelligence.
