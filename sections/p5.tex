Perceptrons are a great tool for building logical functions that would be extremely difficult to explicitly express in standard logical statements. However, this is not where their true powers lie. The Perceptron is an old concept, but they are key in building the most powerful tools. Neural networks and machine learning algorithms build on these concepts and the mathematical foundations of perceptrons to build more powerful systems. These neural nets have already accomplished great feats such as beatings humans in chess and the Chinese game Go. 

We believe these neural nets and machine learning algorithms have the potential to enable general Artificial Intelligence. However, there are a few qualms regarding general AI: it is important to realize that we are building a system that is smarter than us. There is no telling as to how it thinks because that is beyond our scope of thought. It is a possibility that this juggernaut elects to destroy humans because it considers us inefficient and error-prone. Hence, we urge our readers who aspire to work which such systems to tread carefully. The systems that you build to cure cancer might be the same system that results in the the extinction of the human race. Godspeed.
